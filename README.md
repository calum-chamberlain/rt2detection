# rt2detection
Python implimentation of RefTek data to earthquake catalogue

**NOT MAINTAINED**

See the doc directory for full sphinx documentation of this project.

Started in 2014 to enable seismologists working on the DFDP real-time seismicity monitoring effort to download data from
RefTek dataloggers and simply and quickly:
- convert the data to miniseed
- archive the data
- detect earthquakes using a simple sta/lta routine
- store the earthquake information in a Seisan format
- Utilise automatic pickers in a Python/Seisan mixture

This package was initially written by Calum Chamberlain of Victoria University of Wellington during his Phd, while
learning Python and C - any help is appreciated!
Laura-May Baratin is going to be involved in this project as well.
